Microservice framework for node.js to make container-based microservice web applications and APIs more enjoyable to write. Micro is based on koa.js, allowing you to use all the features that koa has.

## Features

> Make microservice reachable 

![arch](https://github.com/Authing/micro.js/blob/master/assets/Architecture.png?raw=true)

1. Deploying micro services with docker containers
2. Transferring the data between the services via JSON strings and RESTful API
3. Every single serivice has it's own database
4. API Gateway serve as the controlling unit, which controls the whole system.You can do some universal works like auth or log
5. Monitoring services and automaticlly restarting the crushed services
6. Visual admin panel to manage and monitor services
7. Easily Integrated with Express.js or Koa.js
8. DevOps supported

## Installation

Micro requires node v7.6.0 or higher for ES2015 and async function support, also requires docker.

```
$ npm install micro.js
```

## Getting started

### init

``` javascript

const routers = {
  '/': {
    controller: function(ctx, next) {
      ctx.body = 'index api 0.1';
    },
    method: 'get'
  }
}

var opts = {
  router: {
    configs: routers, //router configs
    routeNotFound: function() {}, //called when router can't be found
    methodNotSupported: function() {} //called when method can't be supported
  }
}

var myMicroService = new Micro(opts);

```

### Register service

``` javascript

var exampleService = myMicroService.registerService({
    name: 'example',
    function: () => {
        console.log('service example');
    }
});

```
This will run the service in a docker named ```'micro_example'```.

### Register database

``` javascript

var exampleDB = exampleService.registerDatabase({
  name: 'example-db',
  type: 'mongodb',
  connection: {
    username: '',
    password: ''
  }
});

```
This will run the database service in a docker named ```'micro_example_db_example-db'```.When registered, database service's  logical service will be notified, and you can use the database instance in its callback function.

### Manage micro service

#### Start a service

``` javascript

exampleService.start();

```

#### Stop a service

``` javascript

exampleService.stop();

```

#### Restart a service

``` javascript

exampleService.reStart();

```

database service has the same methods.

### Run the project

``` javascript

myMicroService.run(3000);

```

Then the project will run in port 3000, and every stopped docker will be started when the project is running.
